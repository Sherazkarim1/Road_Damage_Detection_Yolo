Report on Road Condition Detection using YOLO on Gilgit Roads
1. Introduction
In this project, we developed an object detection model using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework to identify various road conditions on the roads of Gilgit, including right turns, left turns, straight paths, and potential hazards like landslides. This project aims to increase road safety by enabling real-time detection of road conditions in images captured on Gilgit's roads. By training this model with actual images from the region, we created a solution tailored to Gilgit's specific road environments, which often feature mountainous landscapes and potential landslide areas.

2. Objective
The primary objective of this project was to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing road conditions to assist in real-time navigation and road safety. The model was trained to detect:

Right turns
Left turns
Straight roads
Landslides or unexpected obstructions
4. Methodology
4.1 Data Collection
Location: Roads in Gilgit were selected to capture the diverse conditions and unique road structures.
Tools Used: A mobile camera was used to capture images at various angles and lighting conditions (daytime, dusk, etc.).
Dataset Size: We collected and used approximately 2,500 images for training and testing, ensuring a balanced representation of each road condition.
4.2 Data Labeling
Labeling Tool: We used LabelImg to manually annotate each image.
Classes Defined:
Left Turn
Right Turn
Straight Road
Landslide
Labeling Process: Bounding boxes were drawn around each identified road condition, with each image reviewed for label accuracy.
4.3 Model Selection and Training
Model Choice: We selected YOLOv5 due to its efficiency in real-time object detection, which aligns well with the project’s needs.

Dataset Split: The data was split into training (70%), validation (20%), and testing (10%) sets.

Hyperparameters:

Batch Size: 16
Epochs: 100
Learning Rate: 0.001
Input Image Size: 416x416 pixels
Training Configuration: We trained the YOLO model using a GPU to optimize processing time, which was critical for training a large dataset.

Framework: YOLOv5 was implemented using the PyTorch framework.

4.4 Testing and Evaluation
Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Average Precision (mAP): The model achieved an mAP of 85.4% on the test dataset, indicating high accuracy in detecting road conditions.
Precision and Recall:
Precision: 87.2%
Recall: 82.9%
Loss: Training and validation loss were monitored to prevent overfitting, with regular adjustments to the learning rate.
Test Results: The model was able to accurately detect road conditions in real-time across different images, showcasing robustness across varying lighting and terrain conditions.

5. Results
The model's performance was evaluated on test images, achieving reliable accuracy in detecting right turns, left turns, straight roads, and landslides. Below are sample outputs:

Sample Detection Outputs:
Right Turns: The model correctly identified right turns in 92 out of 100 test cases.
Left Turns: Left turns were accurately detected in 89 out of 100 cases.
Straight Roads: Straight paths were detected with an accuracy of 90.3%.
Landslides: Landslide obstructions were identified with an accuracy of 83.7%.

6. Challenges and Solutions
Lighting Variations: Due to the mountainous environment in Gilgit, lighting conditions vary widely. We addressed this by training the model on images taken under various lighting scenarios.
Data Imbalance: Initially, certain conditions (e.g., landslides) were underrepresented. We augmented data by generating synthetic images to balance the dataset.
Computational Constraints: Training YOLO models can be resource-intensive, so we utilized cloud-based GPU resources for more efficient training.
7. Conclusion
This project successfully developed a YOLO-based object detection model tailored for road conditions in Gilgit, demonstrating the potential of AI in enhancing road safety. The model’s ability to detect different road conditions accurately can be applied in real-world scenarios, particularly for autonomous navigation and advanced driver assistance systems. Future improvements could include expanding the dataset to cover other seasonal and weather conditions in Gilgit for improved robustness.

8. Future Work
Expand Dataset: Collect additional data during different seasons and weather conditions.
Enhance Model Efficiency: Experiment with YOLOv7 or other lightweight architectures for improved efficiency.
Deployment: Integrate the model into an embedded system or mobile application for on-the-go detection.
